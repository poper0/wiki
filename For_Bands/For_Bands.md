WMFO and On the Side are located on the 3rd floor of Curtis Hall at 474
Boston Avenue, Medford, MA 02155. It’s a good idea to park on the street
in front of the station and unload your gear into the ground floor of
Curtis Hall. You may then park on Boston Ave and return to carry your
equipment upstairs.

When you arrive, contact the person who booked you so that you may let
into the station. If you cannot reach your host, you can call the
station at 617-627-3800 – this line goes to the DJ who is on the air.
You may have to wait a bit or call back if the DJ is unable to
immediately answer the phone.  

If you’re playing live, your session will be broadcast on 91.5 FM and
streamed online through wmfo.org. Lastly, as WMFO and On the Side are
college organizations, no alcohol or drugs are allowed in the building
and our station is smoke free.

Band Responsibilities 
---------------------

As the artist, there are a number of things you can do to ensure the
session goes smoothly. First is to show up on time - for a radio show,
this normally means 2 to 3 hours before you’re scheduled to go on. Being
punctual will allow you to enjoy the benefit of a complete sound-check,
enabling you to play your full set with professional sound quality.
Drums are especially important to set up promptly, as it’s nearly
impossible for the engineer to start mic-ing or setting up any other
equipment until the drums are in place.

Second, as we are on the third floor and in a small room, it is a good
idea to bring equipment you would use in a smaller venue. This not only
allows easier movement around the room, but it also means less energy
carrying your gear up and down three flights of stairs.

The engineer’s priority will be producing the best quality
broadcast/recording. We will try to do our best to accommodate any
requests, but a final decision will be made by the engineer based on the
specific circumstances of the session.

How Will the Live Session Go? 
-----------------------------

For the typical band, expect about an hour of load-in and set-up time.
After this, you can sit in the lounge or the vinyl library while the
engineer sets up mics, cables, etc. This should take around thirty
minutes. After everything is set up, you’ll sound check for about an
hour. At this point you should be ready to go on the air.

Be aware that these times are approximate. Each part may take more or
less time depending on various circumstances. The two and a half hour
prep time should provide enough leeway to get everything prepared so
that you may go live on time with the best possible sound. However,
expect to take the entire two and a half hours.  If we are ready
earlier-sweet. Enjoy some relaxation before rocking the airwaves!
