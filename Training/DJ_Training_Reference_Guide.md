General Station Info 
--------------------

A brief overview of the station.

### Rooms within WMFO 

-   Studios - Studio A is the primary on-air studio. Studio B is used
    for band mixing and recording proceedures. Studio C is the auxiliary
    studio which is capable of recording as well as an alternate/backup
    studio for on or off air use. Studio Dee (in honor of Mikey Dee of
    On The Town) is the "live" band room.
-   Bathroom
-   Libraries - Lots of music on the walls. Probably a fire hazard.

### The Executive Board 

Oversees WMFO and makes strategic decisions, improvements, and runs
community events and relations. Also does the money stuff to keep the
station on the air.

See the Executive Board page.

    show

#### Rivendell Use 

-   **Starting/Stopping automation** - Simply press "Automation ON" to
    turn it on, and "OFF" to turn it off. Rivendell fader must be up.
    Please stop it when you're doing your show: don't just put the fader
    down as it logs to Spinitron automatically.
-   **Searching** - Press search and key in. Keep the "First 100"
    checked unless you're pulling a lot of songs. (make sure you don't
    accidentally do an empty query without first 100 checked) To help
    you out you can reorder alphabetically by song title or artist.

    whether songs play consecutively or stop when the end of the song is
    reached

    RDAirplay and a song is highlighted, press the green play button.
    Now select the External 2 feed above the monitor volume knob. You
    should hear the rivendell preview coming over the monitors.

### The Phone 

-   If listener lines (7-3800, 7-3801) ring during your show, DJ is
    responsible for answering it: “WMFO, how can I help you?”

#### Answering the Phone off-air 

-   Press phone button to "unhook" the phone.
-   Hold preview and press talkback.
-   Speak into DJ mic (1) and listen through DJ headphones

#### Putting a Caller on Air 

How to put a phone call on air:

Answer the phone by pressing the phone button.  You must be sure you let
the person know that they will be put/are on the air.

-   Take phone off preview or talkback (if applicable)
-   Turn on the channel and move telephone slider up
-   Mic 1 (or other microphone) must ALSO be on-air for you to be heard
    as well.
-   You can talk into the microphone and you will hear the caller
    through the headphones.
-   When you’re done, press off button on telephone slider and lower the
    slider. Hang up by pressing the phone button again.
-   If you answer the call to air, you must tell them they are on the
    air right away: "WMFO, you're on the air!"

General Policies 
----------------

### Visitors 

-   DJs are responsible for all non-staff persons in the studio during
    their show. 
-   On-air DJ is ultimately responsible for anything a guest does, says
    or breaks during their show.
-   This policy includes "Recurring Guests" or untrained Co-Hosts.

### Volunteering Requirements 

-   Log hours in the book by the door. (Possibility of online system
    soon)
-   5 hours a semester
-   3 hours must come from activities other than on-air subbing

### On-Air Subbing 

You may request a sub by emailing a brief note to
wmfo-sublist@googlegroups. You may accept a sub opportunity by
responding to a request received. You may request a sub for up to three
shows per semester. There is no hard limit on how many shows you can
sub, but please be curteous (If you have subbed 20 times in the past two
weeks, try giving others a turn!).

We have had some confusion regarding this point recently, so this is
important:

-   You MAY NOT "give" a show to your friend. All shows must go through
    the sub list
-   If you are going to miss more than three shows during a semester,
    please contact the Programming Director

Equipment Description/Use 
-------------------------

### The Sound Board 

-   Red "On" vs. Yellow "Off" Buttons
-   **Laptop Instructions - **Make sure that you turn your laptop volume
    UP ALL THE WAY. If you forget until music is already playing,
    holding the "shift" key will stop the clicking noise.
-   **Microphone Levels** - Start of by setting each fader to the red
    line (when viewed from standing up position). You should judge all
    levels by the far left meter with **"PGM 1"** written below it. The
    level on the far left meter should hover around the red mark on the
    meter. The levels turning red is not necessarily a bad thing. See
    the [DJ
    Handbook](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/DJ_Handbook "DJ Handbook")'s
    sound board section for a level diagram and pictures.
-   **Monitoring Section** (on the lower right) - Program 1 is the feed
    leaving the sound board. External 1 is the live feed from an
    in-station FM receiver. Exernal 2 is the Rivendell preview feed
    (when you're searching and press play). All of these sources can be
    listened on either the DJ headphones or the Monitors.

#### Sound Board Sources 

-   Rivendell Slider
-   CD Player Sliders
-   Turntable Sliders
-   iPod/Input Slider (Aux 1 & 2)
-   Telephone Sliders
-   CD Players 1 – 3
-   Turntable
-   DJ Mixer Setup (look left)

#### Basic Sound Board Tips and Tricks 

-   **Reset the Profile to Default:** Press the "Profile" Button in the
    upper right. You can hold for 5 seconds to reload.

-   **Previewing a Source:** Press preview button on desired channel and
    listen through headphones.

-   You can set a channel to Program 2 (make sure to shut program 1 off)
    and then set the monitors to Program 2 as well to listen off-air.

-   Typically Monitor listens to Ext1 feed (this is the feed from an
    actual receiver listening to the air. If you hear static, call
    someone.). Headphones listen to Program 1.

#### Broadcast Volume Levels 

-   Put volume sliders near the red. Always remember, "Middle-ish is
    good-ish."
-   The blue bars should never peak and the bars should not turn
    constantly red.

#### Hosting bands live on air 

-   If your trainees are interested in hosting bands and using these
    studios, make sure they know that they must be properly trained to
    do so before they attempt to.  If they need engineering assistance,
    they should contact
    [wmfo-engineers@googlegroups.com](mailto:wmfo-engineers@googlegroups.com "mailto:wmfo-engineers@googlegroups.com")
