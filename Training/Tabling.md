We get asked to play music at various campus events, and it's also a
great publicity tool. Here's how to work the required equipment. It's
heavy, so you'll want a car to trek it around the hill.

### Allen & Heath for DJs 

The mobile Allen & Heath board is what you'll do your mixing on, and
works rather differently from the Axia baord in Studio A. For starters,
the grey faders are mono (like mics), the blue faders are stereo (like
your iPod out), don't worry about the yellow one, and the red faders are
the master volume. The input jacks, knobs, and fader in a vertical strip
all go together.

### What to bring 

-   The Allen & Heath from Tech 2, in its big Gator case. It should have
    a power cable and two aux cables (dual 1/4" TS to single 1/8" TRS
    aka headphone jack), if not bring some.
-   The speakers and their poles, and power cables for them.
-   Extension cords and power strips.
-   2 mics (SM58 or Beta58) and stands.
-   5 XLR cables: two for the speakers, two for the mics, one spare.
-   The swag box, with the banner and gaffers tape and swag.
-   Optionally, a pair of headphones.
-   A table, if one is not provided.

Keep track of it (especially the mics) and make sure they all get home.

### Setup 

-   Connect the mic(s) to mono faders via XLR.
-   Connect the aux cables to stereo faders. They go to the connectors
    go in the lower of the two pairs above the fader. Follow the
    red/white convention on the RCA connectors above them (which aren't
    part of the fader).
-   Connect the main out XLR to the speakers, which need power and also
    have gain knobs on the back.
-   Plug in the board and press the power switch on the back.
-   Also, hang the banner on the table.

### Operation 

-   For faders you are using, unmute them (above the fader), put the
    gain up (red knob at top of fader, in different spots for mono and
    stereo), and put the fader up when in use.
-   Put the red master volume fader up.
-   Optionally, mess around with the frequency controls until the source
    sounds good.
