General Staff Info {.editable}
------------------

This section contains information for WMFO's General Staff regarding
WMFO.

For more information, see the [WMFO
Constitution](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Constitution "Constitution")
and [Staff Information](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info "Staff Info")
wiki pages.

### About the Station {.editable}

WMFO is a student-run FM broadcast station owned by the Trustees of
Tufts University and run entirely by Tufts students. WMFO is a home to
radio shows hosted by both Tufts students and members of the
Medford/Somerville community. WMFO is governed and run by the Executive
Board, a group of student staff members elected each year by the General
Staff. For more information on the Executive Board, please visit the
[Executive
Board](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board "Executive Board")
page on the WMFO Wiki.

### General Staff {.editable}

WMFO DJs, Subs, and other volunteers constitute the station's General
Staff. DJs can either host weekly or bi-weekly shows or be Substitutes
(Subs), filling in for DJs who cannot attend their own shows. Other
volunteers are involved in critical departments at WMFO such as the
Music Department, the Operations Department, the Publicity Department,
and On The Side, WMFO's recording studio arm. Once you become a member
of the General Staff, there are certain legal obligations and
responsibilities to the station that you must adhere to.

General Staff meetings occur once a semester and allow staff members to
raise concerns, receive scheduling information, and participate in
station-wide decisions such as Executive Board elections and larger
station policy initiatives. General Staff meetings are announced via
[WMFO's General Staff
Newsgroup](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Staff_Newsgroups "Staff Newsgroups").
Attendance is required.

#### Becoming a DJ or Sub {.editable}

Training occurs once per semester, and is overseen by the [Training
Coordinator](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board/Programming_Dept./Training_Office "Training Office").
Training takes place over a three-week period. During this time,
trainees attend a designated show once a week where they learn both the
technical and personal aspects of hosting a radio show. In the first
week, the trainer (i.e. show host) will demonstrate how the station
operates. In the second and third weeks, trainees practice hosting the
show. This includes gaining familiarity with the board, phones, and
WMFO's vast library of music. After trainees complete training, they
must pass a quiz on WMFO's Training Education Management System (TEMS)
in order to receive a Show Application and Scheduling Form (Show Form)
and DJ Agreement and Information Form (DJ Agreement). These forms are
turned in as part of a Show Application Packet and evaluated by the
Executive Board. The Show Application Packet is then processed in WMFO's
scheduling process. Once scheduling has been completed and the new
schedule has been announced via [WMFO's General Staff
Newsgroup](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Staff_Newsgroups "Staff Newsgroups"),
all trainees are considered full General Staff members privy to all the
rights and responsibilities that being a WMFO staff member entails.

#### Becoming a Volunteer {.editable}

All volunteers are trained by their relevant departments. After trainees
complete training, they must turn in a DJ Agreement and Information Form
(DJ Agreement) every semester that they will be involved with WMFO. If a
DJ Agreement was turned in as part of a Show Application Packet for a
given semester, a second DJ Agreement does not need to be turned in.
Once a DJ Agreement has been turned in **and station access has been
confirmed** by the [Program
Director](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board/Programming_Dept. "Programming Dept."),
all volunteers are considered full General Staff members privy to all
the rights and responsibilities that being a WMFO staff member entails.

#### Getting Access to the Station {.editable}

Upon the completion of training and scheduling, Tufts ID cards are
authorized to open the touch-acess exterior door to Curtis Hall as well
as the two card-swipe doors in Curtis Hall. All new General Staff
members will be notified by the [Program
Director](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board/Programming_Dept. "Programming Dept.")
via [WMFO's General Staff
Newsgroup](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Staff_Newsgroups "Staff Newsgroups")
once cards have been authorized. If you are a community member or Tufts
alum, you must then go to Administrative Services in the garage of
Dowling Hall to obtain a Tufts ID card. For more information, please
visit the [Card
Access](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Card_Access "Card Access") page
on the Wiki.

#### Station Responsibilities {.editable}

In order to retain membership at WMFO, General Staff members must adhere
to station policies outlined in the [WMFO
Constitution](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Constitution "Constitution")
and on the [General
Policies](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/General_Policies "General Policies")
page on the WMFO Wiki regarding both personal behavior and
responsibilities to the station. In addition, DJs are responsible for
completing five (5) volunteer hours each semester they have a show. If
you are a Substitute for a semester, you are responsible for three (3)
non-subbing volunteer hours in order to remain active. All General Staff
members are also required to attend General Staff meetings held at the
beginning of each semester. All General Staff members are also required
to join and read/receive all emails sent to [WMFO's General Staff
Newsgroup](http://groups.google.com/group/wmfo-staff "http://groups.google.com/group/wmfo-staff").
All DJs and Subs are also required to join (and use)
[Spinitron](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Staff_Services/Spinitron "http://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Staff_Services/Spinitron")
and [WMFO's Sub Request
List](http://groups.google.com/group/wmfo-sublist "http://groups.google.com/group/wmfo-sublist").
