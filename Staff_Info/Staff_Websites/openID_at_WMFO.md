*Note: Many WMFO sites support openID, but none require it. If anything
here sounds too complicated, feel free to ignore it and create separate
accounts for each page.*

What Is openID? 
---------------

openID is a collective effort eliminate the necessity of having a
different login for every website of which you are a member. It
essentially provides an individual with an Internet 'ID' that the user
can use to prove his or her identity to any website and thus avoid
having to create separate usernames and passwords. As a passport is to
airports, so is openID to Web 2.0. For more information
visits: [http://openid.net/](http://openid.net/ "http://openid.net/") or
view the [wikipedia
page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID").

How Do I Get One? 
-----------------

Getting an openID is really easy, so much so that you probably already
have one. A Gmail account and many other web services can act as your
openID provider. See here for a complete list of
providers: [http://openid.net/get-an-openid/](http://openid.net/get-an-openid/ "http://openid.net/get-an-openid/").

Additionally, if you register for the [public
website](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Staff_Websites "Staff Info/Staff Websites"),
your author page (the page that comes up when you click on your username
in a message you've posted) can act as your openID. Simply use your
author page URL
([http://www.tuftsfreeformradio.org/?author=](http://www.tuftsfreeformradio.org/?author= "http://www.tuftsfreeformradio.org/?author=")\<authorID\>)
as your openID and then provide your login credentials for the public
site when prompted to.

How Can I Use An openID with WMFO 
---------------------------------

Currently, both the [public website and the
wiki](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Staff_Websites "Staff Info/Staff Websites")
support openID.

### Public Website 

To use an openID on the public website, **complete the [normal
registration
process](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Staff_Websites "Staff Info/Staff Websites")
first**.

Once registered and approved as a contributor, login to your public
website account and open the [Your
openID](http://www.tuftsfreeformradio.org/wp-admin/users.php?page=your_openids "http://www.tuftsfreeformradio.org/wp-admin/users.php?page=your_openids")
page from the navigation column to the left of the control panel screen.
You should then register any openIDs you wish to use to login to the
site.

To login to the site using one of the openIDs you registers, simply
enter the ID URL in the specified field when you[login to the pubic
webpage](http://www.tuftsfreeformradio.org/wp-login.php "http://www.tuftsfreeformradio.org/wp-login.php").
If you are prompted to enter your openID credentials, please do so. You
should then be able to proceed with the login process.

### wiki 

To use an openID on the wiki, you must register your account with an
openID. This process is far less flexible then the public website openID
infrastructure and there is no way to change your decision after
creating a wiki account. If this sounds unpleasant, please don't take
this approach.

To register a new wiki account using an openID, please supply your
openID information to the
[webmaster](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Executive_Board/Operations_Dept./WebMaster's_Lair "Executive Board/Operations Dept./WebMaster's Lair")
when requesting your wiki registration.

Once your new account is created, you can follow the small openID link
on the wiki login page to login to your account using openID.

*Note: To use your Wordpress author homepage from the public site as
your openID on the wiki, select 'openID' as the provider on the wiki
openID login/register page, not 'Wordpress', and supply the URL of your
author page.*
