-   **[wiki.wmfo.org](https://wiki.wmfo.org/ "https://wiki.wmfo.org")** – ***The
    Wiki*** – The purpose of the wiki is to host the bulk of our user
    generated content, both for public and internal use. The wiki has
    good public vs internal access controls and will be used for
    station documentation, DJ training and reference documents, station
    history, individual show pages, and many other things.

        edit most wiki pages, depending upon what security group you are
        in (djs, ops, etc). The wiki
        supports [openID](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Staff_Websites/openID_at_WMFO "Staff Info/Staff Websites/openID at WMFO"),

-   ***DJ Portal*** - The [DJ
    portal](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Operations/Code/DJ_Portal "DJ Portal")
    is still in the planning and development stages. We hope to make it
    a one stop shop for DJs while they are in the station. It will
    provide real time streaming listener info, volunteer logging, chat
    windows, ticket giveaways, and everything else a DJ needs in front
    of them while on the air.
