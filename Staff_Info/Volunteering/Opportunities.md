WMFO hosts volunteering sessions open to all station staff. These
sessions are pre-approved to count towards the **required 5 hours** per
DJ, and **required 3 hours **per Sub. All sessions take place at the
station. To view a calendar listing upcoming volunteer opportunities,
please visit the [Staff
Calendar](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Staff_Calendar "Staff Calendar").

### Volunteer Days {.editable}

Volunteer days take place on certain weekend afternoons. They will be
announced via [WMFO's General Staff
Newsgroup](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Staff_Info/Staff_Newsgroups "Staff Newsgroups") (which
you should be subscribed to and read). Traditionally, volunteers decide
whether CDs are worth adding to Rivendell; we may ask you to bring a CD
player (or laptop) and headphones for this purpose. Other tasks may
include chalking, cleaning, or anything that a department head may need
to be completed.

**Volunteer Days for the Fall 2014 semester** will be on:

-   Sunday, October 26            (1 p.m. to 5 p.m.)
-   Saturday, November 22        (12 p.m. to 4 p.m.)
-   Sunday, December 7            (1 p.m. to 5 p.m.)

### Quality Control {.editable}

Creative Content

You can join the [Publicity
Director](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board/Publicity_Dept. "Publicity Dept.")
and Assistant General Manager in Creative Content sessions, held from
**10 - 11 p.m. on Wednesdays** in Fall 2013. Projects include producing
new publicity materials, on-air promos, and station content. All are
welcome!

### Ops Meetings {.editable}

The [Operations
Department](https://wiki.wmfo.org/About_WMFO/Executive_Board/Operations_Dept. "Operations Dept.")
is responsible for the technical workings of the station. Most of that
work is done at weekly ops meetings.  Technical experience (with power
tools or computers) is a plus but not required. Tasks include
programming, equipment maintenance, facilities improvements, and
cleaning. Announcements regarding current projects and cancellations
will be made on [the ops
list](http://groups.google.com/group/wmfo-ops "http://groups.google.com/group/wmfo-ops"),
an optional newsgroup. For the Spring 2014 semester, meeting times are
**Saturdays at 1 p.m**. You can also contact
[ops@wmfo.org](mailto:ops@wmfo.org "ops@wmfo.org") for more information
on volunteering opportunities in the Ops Department.
