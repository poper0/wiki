WMFO uses
[Spinitron.com](http://www.spinitron.com/ "http://www.spinitron.com/") to
log the material we play over the air and online. Logging your playlists
and talk subjects to Spinitron in real time during your show is
mandatory for all WMFO DJs. Logging to Spinitron helps us to meet our
sound performance reporting obligations. It also provides a service to
our listeners by allowing them to view what is currently playing on WMFO
or what played at any previous point in time. The "Now Playing" and RRS
feeds are all drawn form the Spinitron servers.
