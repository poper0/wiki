After the Drive

After the conclusion of the Donation Drive, Advancement should be sent a
list of donor information. Advancement should then send each donor a
letter and tax receipt. Station leadership should add all donors to the
WMFO Listeners elist
([wmfo-listeners@googlegroups.com](mailto:wmfo-listeners@googlegroups.com "mailto:wmfo-listeners@googlegroups.com")). An
individual on the Executive Board should also undertake Donations Drive
reward fulfillment. This consists of obtaining rewards and packaging
material, addressing envelopes, writing thank-you letters, and mailing
rewards.
