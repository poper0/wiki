As a community radio station, WMFO airs at least one Public Service
Announcement (PSA) each hour. If you have a PSA you would like us to
broadcast on you or your organization's behalf, please submit it via the
guidelines below.

### WMFO Public Service Announcement Guidelines {.editable}

WMFO accepts both audio and hardcopy Public Service Announcements for
informing our listener audience about non-commercial activities and
issues. As a public broadcasting station there are no costs to the
sponsoring organization for airing the PSAs. WMFO especially likes to
help Tufts-based and local organizations promote their activities, and
gives them special consideration.

All PSAs should include the name of the sponsoring organization, and if
applicable, contact information such as a web site and phone number --
Note that long URLs can be both difficult for DJs to read on air as well
as for listeners to remember, so it can be more effective to direct
users to use a search engine with a phrase that readily finds your page
(e.g. "For more information just search for 'Tufts Community Day' on the
web").

Hardcopy PSAs should be printed on 8.5" x 11" letter size paper, and all
fit on one side of one page. Audio PSAs should be either mailed to us in
standard audio CD format, or emailed/linked as (preferably lossless) WAV
or MP3 files.

PSAs are generally processed weekly on Thursday evenings for initial
broadcast beginning on Friday evenings, so please submit PSAs to the
station by 5 pm Thursdays for inclusion the following week. The longer
the lead time, the more opportunities there are for the PSA to receive
airplay, so it's best to submit PSAs in conjunction with the Thursday
deadline so they'll have at least a week to run, but a month is even
better.

The PSA Department applies its discretion regarding the broadcast of
submitted announcements; in particular we don't permit those that are
fundamentally advertisements from for-profit entities. Under no
circumstances do we state any pricing information on the air. If a
non-commercial organization is sponsoring an event that requires
admission, we can mention the event, and where to go for more
information, but not the particular cost.

WMFO DJs are free to air any approved PSA on their shows, so for maximum
publicity an organization should submit both a hard copy PSA that can be
read, and an audio PSA for those DJs that prefer to play them.

You can send your PSA to WMFO as follows:

Edward Beuchert\
 Public Service Director\
 WMFO 91.5 FM\
 P.O. Box 53065\
 Medford, MA 02155

You can also email your PSA as a plain text file, pdf, or legacy Word
document (with a ".doc" extension but not ".docx" or XML) to
[psa@wmfo.org](mailto:psa@wmfo.org "mailto:psa@wmfo.org"). Please
include your group's affiliation and "PSA" on the subject line.
