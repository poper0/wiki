This is your crazed 3AM guide to getting WMFO back on the air after an
unexpected power outage or freezeup of the Studio A board.

1.  Bypass the board. Change COND1 (192.168.0.110) Destination 8 to
    10300 (SA-RD-Main) or 13500 (SC-Pgm1). Send out audio on that
    source.
2.  Visit 192.168.1.20 and login. Go to the outlet control page and
    execute a "reboot immediate" operation which will unplug power for
    30 seconds.
3.  Attempt to communicate with the board after about 2 mintues on
    192.168.1.160. If you get a webpage, you can continue. Otherwise,
    try shutting off the board for an extended period (10 minute maybe).
    We think it may be a thermal problem.
4.  If the rightmost 4 faders aren't on, lift up the back of the board
    and disconnect the ethernet line running to them (it is located on
    the far right if you're looking at the back). If they
    say `INACTIVE`, hold `*` and `2` until they say `CAPTURE`, then hit
    the return key on the board.
5.  Remember if you put the phones on Studio C's board that they can
    only be on one board at a time. You'll have to remove them before
    they'll work properly in Studio A.
6.  Once you are confident the board is up (do the phone faders show
    dots?), restore COND1 destination 8 to 10500 (CONSE1-Pgm1). Lock up
    and go home.
7.  If you can't get the board up but are good to go in Studio C, lock
    the door to A and leave a note on it, and consult the ops list.
8.  If board failure is preventing us from broadcasting, and you have no
    other contacts or ideas, call Axia 24 hour support at
    (800) 552-8227.

 

Do not power cycle the Furman because this takes down the analog node
too, and one time the board did not like not having it. The Element
power supply and Studio Enginer should be power cycled as a pair, but if
you can get to the Element web page you may be able to reboot it gently.
The rightmost 4 faders are a diferent style module than the others (in
order to answer the phones) and for some reason they don't come up as
cleanly as the others. Also, it appears that the Studio C board is more
likely to come up cleanly after a power outage (it's newer and the
hardware is in one place) so you can generally stick the DJ in there
while you work. You can even do the changeover (step 1)
[remotely](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Operations/Credentials/Remote_Access "Remote Access").
