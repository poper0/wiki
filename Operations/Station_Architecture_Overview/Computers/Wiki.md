Before you begin, have this page and the Internal Credntials page open.
You will be taking this very wiki offline and not be able to access
them.

We've seen Rivendell freeze up during the backup run, most likely due to
overtaxing Super's read/write ability, so play something else.

Backing up 
----------

1.  Log into Smooth using the Windows credentials, and then into the VM
    Server Home Page / VMware Infrastructure Web Access using the same
    credentials. Ignore warnings about certificates.
2.  Take a VM snapshot (click the VM on the left, then under commands on
    the right).
3.  Shut down the guest OS and power down the VM.
4.  On *Super*, run the Synctoy VirtualMachines2 job to back everything
    up to the other server.
5.  Power up the wiki VM. The Guest OS should come up automatically (be
    patient).

 

Updating Software 
-----------------

1.  Back up the wiki as described above.
2.  Launch either the VM terminal or SSH into the machine using the
    [MindTouch\_wikiWMFO credentials](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Operations/Credentials/Internal_Credentials "Internal Credentials").
3.  Follow the directions here for upgrading a VM install:  [Upgrading
    the
    wiki](http://developer.mindtouch.com/en/docs/MindTouch_Administration_Guide/Upgrading_MindTouch/Upgrading_MindTouch_VMware_Appliance "http://developer.mindtouch.com/en/docs/MindTouch_Administration_Guide/Upgrading_MindTouch/Upgrading_MindTouch_VMware_Appliance")
    1.  You may need to update some of the system packages using
        apt-get. Often, you need the *backports* version of a repo to
        satisfy dependencies. Try *apt-get -t lenny-backports
        \<command\>* if you have issues.
    2.  Mono 2.10 has been installed from source using the instructions
        [here](http://developer.mindtouch.com/en/docs/mindtouch_setup/010Installation/020Installing_on_Debian/Installing%2F%2FUpgrading_Mono_on_Debian "http://developer.mindtouch.com/en/docs/mindtouch_setup/010Installation/020Installing_on_Debian/Installing%2F%2FUpgrading_Mono_on_Debian").
        If you need to update it, you might also have to build it from
        source.
    3.  However, when it comes to actually run *updateWIki.sh*, you'll
        want to become root (run *su*) first.

4.  Test to ensure everything is working (except openID).
5.  If it works, go to step 7.
6.  If it's broken, revert the VM snapshot so everything works again and
    see if you can find a solution offline. Then repeat from step 2.
7.  Restart the VM.
8.  Test everything again.
9.  If it works (and make sure it does as this step will be
    irreversible), make a new backup.
10. If it's broken, revert the VM snapshot so everything works again and
    see if you can find a solution offline. Then repeat from step 2.
