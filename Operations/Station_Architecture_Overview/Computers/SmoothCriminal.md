Services {.editable}
--------

Smoothcriminal is the last Windows host following the untimely death of
Supertramp.

### IIS7 {.editable}

As of 7/14, most services are hosted on the Linode or elsewhere. What
remains is a legacy FTP fileshare and the "Default Website" which hosts
data.txt, a huge file of all the telemetry data since the dawn of time
(aka 2009).

### Lynx 5 {.editable}

This is the legacy program by Burk which interfaces with the IP
Telemetry unit in the tower to download telemetry readings every day. It
is started by a Windows service in the background so that it may
download and then killed. A service then dumps the database file into a
text file and pushes it to the data.txt web file.

###  EAS Configuration {.editable}

This has a windows program necessary to configure the EAS box.

### Fileshares {.editable}

It currently houses the secondary RAID and exposes some shares.
