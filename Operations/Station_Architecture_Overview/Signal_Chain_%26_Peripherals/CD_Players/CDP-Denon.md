Note 1: Previously WMFO had used the CD player EOM signal to trigger a
count-down timer via a second Axia GPIO port. This secondary GPIO port
used the Axia "Studio Monitor" GPIO profile on which pin 14 is the
countdown timer trigger.  As of the Studio A overhaul in January 2011,
we no longer use the EOM signal, nor a second GPIO port, and this wire
has been disconnected on the Axia side.  As of July 2012, the CD GPIO
cables in Studio A still have this pin wired on the device side. The
brown wire on these cables should thus be ignored and must be
disconnected on the Axia side to prevent it from interfering with the
main CD player GPIO profile.
