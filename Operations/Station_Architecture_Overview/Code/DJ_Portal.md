The DJ Portal is currently in the planning stage. It is expected, but
not firmly decided, that the DJ Portal will be for on-air real-time
access.

Feature List (Tentative) 
------------------------

-   Flag songs in Rivendell as unsuitable for automation (prfoanity,
    long silence), preferably knowing only when the song was played.
-   More generally, report an issue to ops list (maybe via a ticket
    tracker like
    [RT](http://bestpractical.com/rt/ "http://bestpractical.com/rt/"))
-   List of active listeners (via Shoutcast)
-   Ticket Give-away
-   Staff announcements
-   Upcoming volunteer opportunities
-   Volunteer hour recording
-   Unified chat client (maybe integrating Spinitron Chat)
-   Social media updater (do we want to give DJs control of these?)
-   Clock in and out (do we really want to take attendance?)
-   Unified log in to spinitron, wiki, Wordpress (is this really
    necessary? No, but it is handy. Maybe via OAuth or OpenID)
-   MD Reccomendations (from rotation, Rivendell, charts, etc.)
-   General static info (can't use posted hard copies?)
-   Access to wiki (training manual, answering phone)
-   DJ training and signup resources (deactivatable as necessary)
-   Weekly/Monthly song statistics (top album, top artist, top genre,
    etc)
