Overview 
--------

The WMFO PSA department has access to the Rivendell system in order to
conduct their duties of importing new PSAs into the Rivendell digitial
library and placing relevant PSAs on the sound panels of Rivendell.

 

PSA Drive Space 
---------------

The PSA department has a personal spot on the Supertramp/Smoothcriminal
data shares. It is used for transferring files from the MD computer to a
place where a Rivendell program can access them.

 

PSA Accounts 
------------

PSA has user accounts on the MD computer, TinMachine (Studio A computer)
and its own Rivendell user account. The PSA account on the MD computer
(actually a domain account) mounts the PSA share and allows PSA
department members to upload new PSAs on to the share. It also has
shortcuts to an NX Client (NX is NoMachine, the remote graphical access
used to remotely access TinMachine by the PSA department) that will open
TinMachine.

 

The TinMachine user account is accessed remotely by the PSA department,
either through the MD computer or via their own personal computers. Once
logged in, they can import their PSAs using rdlibrary. The can also edit
the soundpanels on TinMachine. The PSA Rivendell account grants them the
permissions to do this.

 

WatchPup 
--------

WatchPup is a script on TinMachine that monitors if someone has logged
out of the PSA Linux account. If so, it sets the Rivendell user to the
regular default user. In the future it should be expanded for automatic
mounting of the /var/PSA directory (which is the mount point for the PSA
share on Super/Smooth) and the /var/backup directory. (Although
TinMachine does not currently backup anything to it.) These shares are
mounted automatically on reboot; it's very rare if ever that they become
unmounted (and a reboot will fix it).
