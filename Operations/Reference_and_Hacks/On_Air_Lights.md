This is the GPIO specification for the On Air Light control lines.

Up to 4 independent light circuits can be driven from a single Cat6
line. Each circuit uses its own D-sub 15 connector.

Control PDU {.editable}
-----------

The grid is driven by an 8 port serial/contact closure Power
Distrabution Unit (PDU), theDataprobe Serial iBootBar sBB-N15
([manual](http://dataprobe.com/support/manuals/pwr/sbb_v1.0x.pdf "http://dataprobe.com/support/manuals/pwr/sbb_v1.0x.pdf")).
The PDU detects GPIO contact closure from the studios and powers on or
off outlets that are connected to the on-air lights.

The PDU is configured via serial console with Baud: 115200, Data: 8,
Stop: 1, Parity: 0.  Access to this device requries credentials found on
the [Internal Credentials
Page](https://wiki.wmfo.org/Operations/Credentials/Internal_Credentials "Internal Credentials").

### Configuration {.editable}

The following table is the current configuration of the device and
intended purpose of each port. Currently only outlets 1, 5, and 6 are
connected to lights, although all control wiring has been done.

  --------------- -------------- ---------- ---------------------------
  **Outlet \#**   **Name**       **Mode**   **Purpose**
  1               SA\_Ext        Closed     SA External Light
  2               SB\_Int        Closed     SB Internal Light
  3               SC\_Int        Closed     SC Internal Light
  4               Outlet4        Open       Distro - Always On
  5               SB/SDee\_Ext   Closed     SB & SDee External Lights
  6               SC\_Ext        Closed     SC External Light
  7               Outlet7        Open       Distro - Always On
  8               Outlet8        Open       Distro - Always On
  --------------- -------------- ---------- ---------------------------

### Changing Config {.editable}

To change the mode of the outlet call:
`set outlet <outlet #> control.on <open/closed>`\
 Open means the outlet is on when the contact is open, and Closed means
the outlet is on when the contact is closed.

The current mode of an outlet can be checked by:
`get outlet <outlet #> control.on`

The current status of all outlets can be checked by: `get outlets`

### D-sub Mapping {.editable}

The D-subs are where the GPIO control signals leave the LiveWire
network.

Studio B Driven {.editable}
---------------

The lights driven by Studio B (B/Dee Externals) are controlled by a
physical switch mounted above the board. This switch is driven by a 3
conductor line spliced off of an 8 conductor Cat6 line.

Note1: The LED - (negative) line is connected to Switch ON 1.\
 Note2: The ground for the Outlet 5 contact is provided by the Studio C
PowerStations; this could be reworked using 4 conductor line and making
use of the two isolated switch lines provided by the mechanical switch.
