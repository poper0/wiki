### Fixing archives not streaming 

On a more recent level, there has been a reccuring (3 times) issue with
archives not playing due to the web server not keeping the proper time.
Steps to fix:

1.  ssh into the Dreamhost server (see hosting credentials). Compare the
    server's clock (run the `date `command) to a known source
    like [time.gov](http://time.gov "http://time.gov") and see if they
    are off by more than 30 seconds.
2.  If yes, log into the Dreamhost panel and file a support ticket
    asking them to reset the NTP daemon. You can see previous support
    tickets if you like.
3.  If the Dreamhost server is on time, it's a new bug on Spinitron's
    side. Follow up with them.
4.  If Spinitron, Dreamhost, and the federal governement agree on the
    time, it's a different bug entirely.
