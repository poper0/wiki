### 8/11/2012

Transmitter went down at around 8AM today. (Apparent power surge from Tufts grid?) Transmitter back up by about 8:30 AM. Super can be pinged from the outside, but the VPN is not working, forcing a direct call in to the telemetry unit. DJ reported wall phone dead. All effects thought to be from Tufts power work. -- Benjamin Yu

4/26/15
-------

New transmitter unit installed at \~ 8:30PM 4/26/15; fully up at about 9:30 PM. Equipment measurements to be completed on Wednesday by Broadcast Signal Lab. AES input levels to the transmitter unit were lowered such that modulation levels were correct. --Benjamin Yu 9:20AM 4/27/2015

Addition: AES input levels on the transmitter were not adjusted; it was in fact output levels from the Omnia unit. They are currently set to -1.1dBFS. The efficiency factor F (as in **Power = Voltage x Current x F**) was calculated at exactly 2/3rds. Forward power was measured at 52 watts by the direct method using the watt meter connected to the RF output of the transmitter unit. The VRC2500 unit is no longer connected to anything as the new transmitter has its own full web interface and SNMP protocol. --Benjamin Yu 9:29 AM 4/27/2015'

5/9

5:02PM off air, on air 5:14PM for Rivendell upgrades. --Nick Andre

5/29/15
-------

Power outage starting at 6:50:12 according to Control UPS. 7:12:49 the UPS shut off output power. 7:18:23 power returned. Lack of automation restart meant that we broadcast dead air until the transmitter was manually shut off by Nick at 10:04 according to transmitter logs. Transmitter was restarted at 12:31 by Nick after Adele was booted manually. --Nick Andre
