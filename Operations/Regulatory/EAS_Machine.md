Overview 
--------

WMFO uses a SAGE Digital ENDEC as its EAS Encoder/Decoder. The unit is
located Bay B, the equipment rack between Studio A and Control. The EAS
unit is connected to a rack mounted radio-monitor unit. This unit is
just two radio tuners that supply audio to the EAS machine. They are
tuned to the [EAS Primary
Stations](http://www.mass.gov/eopss/home-sec-emerg-resp/emergency-info/threat-level/emergency-alert-system-eas-for-massachusetts.html "http://www.mass.gov/eopss/home-sec-emerg-resp/emergency-info/threat-level/emergency-alert-system-eas-for-massachusetts.html")
for the State of Massachusetts: 104.1 FM and 1030 AM. These are the two
stations WMFO is required to monitor in order to relay EAS alerts. Each
has an associated antenna.

Configuration 
-------------

The EAS has inputs and outputs on the Control side. The output is the
same as the input, unless there's an alert, in which case the alert is
output instread. The EAS is therefore part of signal chain. Consult the
Livewire tables to be sure, but it is typically downstream of SA Pgm1
and upstream of the Aphex webstream compressor and tower router
selector. "Bypassing Studio A" means routing a different source into the
EAS-IN destination.

The EAS machine can be configured from the physical front panel of the
machine. The only relevant options from the front panel are the ability
to set the unit's IP address (as it has a NIC card and is presently on
WMFO's internal LAN) and the ability to run an EAS test at will.

Most configuration is done through the web browser interface. A
configuration file can be downloaded from the unit. Once downloaded on
to a Windows PC, the SAGE provided software (installed on Supertramp)
can be used to modify the settings, before uploading to the unit. The
unit reboots (takes around two minutes) when settings are updated. It
likely ceases to function during this time - consider temporarily
routing around it in Livewire.

Required Tests 
--------------

WMFO is required to send out weekly tests of the EAS encoder. Luckily,
the SAGE Digital ENDEC has an option to randomly generate test dates
every week. That option is currently used.

We receive monthly tests from the EAS Primary Stations. The EAS does
will discard duplicate alerts, and it's a tossup which station it hears
from first. As of December 2012, the audio quality of the alerts is
acceptable. The EAS stores tests temporarily. Some radio stations use
this feature to insert the test into programming, but WMFO does not, so
tests play a few minutes after they are received. An actual emergency
alert would be played immediately.

Logging Configuration 
---------------------

WMFO is required to log certain EAS events. The SAGE Digital ENDEC will
log events in its internal memory. This log can be viewed through the
web interface. The EAS machine can also be configured to send logs via
email or by ftp. WMFO uses both of these options.

The EAS is configured to ftp to Smoothcriminal and place log files
there. It uses a special WMFO\\EAS account on the domain to do this. The
root of the ftp is on Smooth's C drive, called "EAS." This is copied
over to the data store and synced between the servers.

The EAS is also configured to send emails to
[ops@wmfo.org](mailto:ops@wmfo.org "mailto:ops@wmfo.org") and
[co@wmfo.org](mailto:co@wmfo.org "mailto:co@wmfo.org"). It uses the
credentials of the donotreply account to send these emails. The password
in the configuration of the SAGE Digitial ENDEC must be updated whenever
the password for
[donotreply@wmfo.org](mailto:donotreply@wmfo.org "mailto:donotreply@wmfo.org")
is updated.

The webpage http://\<EAS Address here\>/mailerr willl show any errors
(since the last reboot) the EAS machine has with logging via email or
ftp. It is useful for debugging.

Miscellaneous 
-------------

During the first national test of the National Emergency EAS code, it
was found that the EAS input gain was too high. This is a problem with
the EAS circuitry. At gains too high, the EAS output will cross-talk
into the input, causing a messages mixed with a delayed version of
itself to be played out over the airwaves. SAGE has leveling guidelines
for this issue, and it has been implemented at WMFO.
