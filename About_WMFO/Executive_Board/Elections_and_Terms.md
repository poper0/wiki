General Info 
------------

All WMFO Exec Board positions are elected at the Spring Staff meeting,
generally held near the end of January. Any
Tufts *undergraduate student* staff member who has been with the station
for at least one semester is eligible to run for any position with the
exception of General Manager. To run for General Manager, you must have
served in a previous Executive Board position for at least one semester
prior to running.

All terms are for 1 year and begin at the start of the summer season
following the January election. The period between the January election
and the start of the summer season is an interim training period. During
this time, Exec Board elects will train for their positions
under the currently serving exec board members.

There are no term limits (beyond the effective 4 year term limit imposed
by the fact that only undergraduate students can hold office). All Exec
board members are expected to put between 5 and 15 hours per week into
the station, depending on their duties and position.

Election Order 
--------------

WMFO Exec Board Positions shall be elected in the following order.
Candidates may opt to run for more than one position, but are only
eligible to run until they are elected to a position (i.e. The winner of
the AGM election is no longer eligible to run for Operations Director,
but the loser(s) of the AGM election could run for Operations Director).
