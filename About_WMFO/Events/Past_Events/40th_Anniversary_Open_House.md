Join us to meet fellow WMFO affiliates, catch up with old friends, tour
our Curtis Hall facilities, and help us celebrate 40 years as Tufts
Freeform Radio!  We at WMFO have been transmitting our Freeform signal
on 91.5 FM from our Curtis Hall studios since 1970, and we figure
it's about time to celebrate!  The event offers the opportunity for
visitors to visit our radio station and see how our broadcasts work both
over FM and online, meet the staff and management, check out our music
collection and learn how we interact with musicians and the industry,
and network with the community while enjoying refreshments and live-spun
tunes.

The event is free and open to the public. Invite your friends and
colleagues!  Directions and a map can be found on the [contact info
page](https://wiki.wmfo.org/General_Info/Contact_Information "Contact Information").

As a courtesy, RSVPs are requested, but not required. If you know you'll
be attending, please let us know by filling out the **[online RSVP
